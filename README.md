# Cinema-Management-System-in-JAVA
An college assignment project built according to the given by requirements. 
Assignment Description:
For this assignment, you are required to design an application for a small cinema. The cinema wants a program that will provide staff with the available movie listings and session times. This is for staff use only.
The program must cater for each of the following requirements:
1) Register a new movie. The cinema needs to store the movieâ€™s title, rating, duration, synopsis, release date, billed cast, director, genre, distributor and official website.
2) Schedule movie sessions. There is only one cinema screen, so only one movie can be shown at any time.
3) Display the movie listing. This lists all movies. When a movie is selected, list all the details for that movie, including its future session times.
4) Display all the session times for a selected day. These should be sorted from the earliest session time to the latest time, and identify which movie is screening at which time.
